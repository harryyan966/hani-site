                In consideration of the lack of bilingual (English and Chinese) teaching materials in these children’s schools in rural Yunnan, students and schools from urban areas including Beijing, Xi’an, Nanjing in China, Philadelphia in the United States, and Quebec in Canada have decided to initiate this project to create translations for comic books and teaching materials for language teaching in those schools. This inspired wish of a group of students at Beijing Haidian International School quickly grew into a full-fledged operation involving more than 8 other schools. The project expanded to include 20 primary schools in Yunnan with approximately 200 students in each school responsible for providing materials for corresponding Yunnan primary schools. This project has become a bridge between students in urban areas and children in rural areas. We strive to provide as much help as possible to those in need and help bridge the inequality gap in education.

                Club presidents from several schools gathered with the same intention: to assist students in rural areas in learning English and to help further the development of the indigenous Hani language. Hence, in this organization, we sent meticulously translated and illustrated picture books and bilingual teaching materials to children in mountainous areas. We hope these translated novels and picture books will help them broaden their horizons, inspire them to protect the Hani people’s language and cultural traditions, and encourage them to pursue their aspirations
