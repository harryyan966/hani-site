                    Hani villages are normally located around lush forests and jungle so that they have abundant water for their fertile terraced fields or valley floor fields.
                    Among all the buildings, the MUSHROOM HOUSE is the most representative of Hani architecture.

                    According to legend, the Hani had been living in caves at an earlier time. After their relocation to a place named Reluo, they discovered an immense field of mushrooms in the mountains and on the plains. The mushrooms have the capacity to resist winds and rains, as well as ants and worms building nests beneath them. The Hani have continued to imitate mushrooms and build mushroom houses ever since.

                <p>                
                    The mushroom-shaped house consists of bamboo and wood scaffolding and a straw roof (the roof has four sloping sides). The architectural design of the two-or three-floor mushroom house is very special and charming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bottom ground floor of the house is for keeping livestock and furniture. People live on the first floor. It normally has 3 rooms. A square shaped fireplace in the middle room has a fire that is kept constantly burning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second floor is covered with fireproof earth and is used as a warehouse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The earth roof insulates the house so that it is warm in winter and cool in summer.

                    Since the mushroom house is an important cultural symbol of the Hani ethnic group, people try hard to protect them form being demolished and forgotten.However, is is extremely hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, people no longer build houses with stone or brick walls and thatched roofs. Instead, they follow modern architecture and have added modern furniture to their homes.Mushroom houses were considered outdated and poor. The traditional central pillar has also been replaced with a wooden pillar in the corner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are several REASONS: 
1.	The old adobe and wood buildings are deteriorating and pose a danger. 
2.	There is a scarcity of wood for construction.
3.	Younger generations prefer modern, well-lit, clean, and secure homes instead of the traditional, cramped, and damp shelters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is quite obvious that the cultural symbols represented by mushroom houses have become disconnected from the lives of the people living in them.

                    Traditional architecture should be appreciated for its ethical values and cultural importance. When confronted with social transformations, these dwellings must redefine their purpose and adjust accordingly. When restoring traditional buildings, it is crucial to honor local traditions, follow cultural preservation principles, support local artisans, and safeguard the historical knowledge and customs linked to these cultural artifacts and structures.

                    According to the ancient legend,the Hani preferred to wear light-colored clothes in the past. Until one day, a mother and her daughter climbed up the mountain to collect medicine.On the way,they encountered a ghost who came out to find food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both of them were frightened and tended to flee.During the time,their clothes were dyed blue and purple by wild indigo leaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unexpectedly, this became their protective color, and the ghost could not see them no matter how close they were, and eventually they survived.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then,Hani consider black as an auspicious , holy and protective color .In addition,the color black plays a significant role in Hani clothing.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this type of plant, called “Banlangen”,has characteristics such as insect repellent, anti-inflammatory, and disease treatment, Hani people process and dye it into clothing, and wear it on their bodies to resist the invasion of pests and bacteria, in order to maintain their physical health.

                <p>                
                    The religious beliefs of the Hani ethnic group mainly include polytheistic worship and ancestor worship. They believe that there are gods such as the Heavenly God, the Earth God, the Mountain God, the Village God, and the Family God, all of which need to be regularly worshipped. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main objects of Hani people's natural worship are :
       mountains ⛰️            water 🏞️             trees🌲 
sun ☀️            moon  🌛                  wind 🌪️
            thunder ⚡                 hail ❄️               earthquakes

        <div class="horizontal-section-container">
            <div>
                <p>                
                    Ancestor worshipping is another important Hani belief. Each Hani family has a very old pedigree that passes on from father down to sons. They believe that the spirits of the ancestors resides in the tombs, Momiluoke, namely the entry to the heaven or the place where the ancestral shrine is worshiped. Therefore sacrifices should be done frequently to win the favors and protection of the God and ancestors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 1920s, Christianity and Buddhism had spread to them, but with little influence. The person who is designated to hold the religious activities is hereditary and doctors cure patients with witchcraft and herbal medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Hani people believe that a person has 12 souls, distributed throughout the body and playing different roles in the health of the human body. Only when all 12 souls fulfill their duties and attach themselves to the human body, can they be healthy and unscathed.
                </p>

                <p>                
                    The practice of the primitive religious belief mainly involves agricultural production and village construction. Sacrifice to the heavens, mountains, and especially dragons are the main contents of worship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dragon is a symbol of rain, and sacrificing the dragon is praying for rain. As is well known, the Hani people live in mountainous areas and suffer from severe water scarcity. For a nation that has entered an agricultural society, water is crucial. Under the living conditions of relying on the heavens for food, people can only seek help from the so-called dragon god in charge of rainwater, and the dragon worship ceremony arises from this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dragon is the protective god in the hearts of the entire village, and it is the most inviolable belief, just like the Greek sun god Apollo. Therefore, the annual dragon worship is a major event held by the entire village.

                <div class="section-title">Traditional festivals of the Hani ethnic group— An unparalleled Calendar</div>
                <p>
                    Seasonal division and agricultural calendar are a major contribution of the Hani people to the human calendar. In the Ailao Mountains, the Hani people divide the whole year into three seasons: "Zaota" as the cold season, 
"Wodu" as the warm season,
"Re wo" as the rainy season, 
with each season lasting four months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The seasonal division of the Hani ethnic group is based on a full understanding of the overall natural ecological environment of Ailaoshan (their hometown), which is very suitable for the specific local situation and more closely reflects and adapts to the seasonal and phased nature of Hani's agricultural ecological terrace farming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On such a calendar that embodies Hani's national wisdom, there are numerous intriguing and meaningful festivals that worth our attention and understanding.

                <p>
                    Definition: In May and June, there is frequent rainfall, and the climate is extremely humid and hot; all the creatures are experiencing an arduous, tough and withering time.

In June, the Kuzha Zha is celebrated because according to the Hani ethnic calendar, the busy season of spring plowing and planting has all come to an end. People hope that the gods will bless the growth of crops and ensure a bountiful harvest. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Custom: Swing is one of the most important customs of the Hani people in June. Each village needs to set up one or two large swing frames. Each village needs to cut four straight and hard trees and vines from the forest, plant wooden stakes on the larger site of the village, and tie swing ropes made of vines. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the celebration begins, each village will kill pigs and cows, prepare a sumptuous banquet and have a meal together. Men, women, and children will gather to engage in entertainment activities mainly focused on swinging. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun Fact: Those brave young men who play on the swing often become the objects of admiration for girls！

                    Definition: According to the ancient calendar of the Hani ethnic group, the first day of October is the beginning of a new year (equivalent to the first day of the Chinese New Year). During the festival, every village holds a street wine feast. In October of the lunar calendar, when rice has just entered the warehouse, every household is pounding glutinous rice and making cakes, baking sweet "stuffy pot wine" and preparing for the new year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the day of October New Year, people prepare various foods and drinks at home, and then go to the graves of their family ancestors for worship activities. In addition to offering sacrifices to ancestors, people also hold activities such as cow racing, sheep racing, archery, and dancing during this festival.
